# [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/)

Advent of Code done in languages I like or want to learn.

Currently:

- JavaScript/TypeScript
- Rust
- C
  - I got to day 3 and needed to implement my own hash map to cache results
  - After finishing, I realized it's going to take forever without a real stdlib
  - So.. probably no C, maybe C++

Each language is in its own folder with instructions on how to run.
