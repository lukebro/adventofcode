# [Advent of Code](https://adventofcode.com/) C Solutions

Using c11 standard.

Using [Fritz179/aoc-2021](https://github.com/Fritz179/aoc-2021) as my template/setup (along with Makefile).

```sh
cd 2015/01
make
```

I got to day 3 and needed to implement my own hash map to cache results
After finishing, I realized it's going to take forever without a real stdlib.
So.. probably no C, maybe C++, but probably just Rust instead.
